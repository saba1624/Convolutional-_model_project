# Model for object tracking and classification in videos.
1.This first project involves the implementation of the "deep sort" algorithm along with the latest YOLOv8 model provided by Ultralytics. This approach is applied to image recognition and classification in videos. My initial goal is to enhance both the detection and classification models to transition towards a real-time object detection and classification model while a drone's camera captures these images, which will be crucial for subsequent decision-making.
